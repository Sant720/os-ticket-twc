# Email Fetching and Outgoing Mail

osTicket allows you to set up multiple email addresses to handle your company’s communication channels.  
Incoming emails can be converted into support tickets, helping you organize and manage all email requests in one place.

This guide explains how to configure **incoming email fetching** and **outgoing mail delivery** in osTicket.

---

## Before You Begin

- Ensure osTicket is already installed and configured.  
- You must have **Admin Panel** access.  
- Confirm that your mail server credentials (username, password, host, and port) are correct.  

---

## Email Templates

osTicket includes a set of default templates for:
- Auto-responses  
- Alerts  
- Notices  
- Staff and client replies  

You can customize or add new templates by following the [Email Templates Guide](../email-templates).

---

## Routing Incoming Emails

osTicket supports two main methods for fetching incoming mail:

### 1. Email Piping (Real-Time Delivery)
Email piping allows instant ticket creation as messages arrive.  
However, it requires configuration at the mail server level.

**To enable email piping:**
1. Access your hosting control panel or mail server configuration.  
2. Create an alias or pipe that sends emails directly to osTicket’s pipe handler (usually `pipe.php`).  
3. Verify that your server supports piping.

> See the [Email Piping Guide](../email-piping) for step-by-step details.

---

### 2. POP3/IMAP Polling (Scheduled Fetching)
POP3/IMAP polling is ideal if you cannot modify mail delivery settings (e.g., using Gmail or external hosts).

Each email address in osTicket can be linked to a POP3 or IMAP account.

**To configure POP3/IMAP fetching:**
1. Go to **Admin Panel → Settings → Email**.  
2. Check the box for **Email Fetching** to enable it (disabled by default).  
3. Add your mail server credentials:
   - Mail Server: `mail.yourdomain.com`
   - Protocol: POP3 or IMAP
   - Port: typically 995 (SSL) or 993 (IMAP SSL)
4. Save the configuration.

> See the [POP3/IMAP Settings Guide](../pop3-imap-settings) for detailed setup steps.

---

## Configuring Outgoing Emails

By default, osTicket uses the **PHP mail()** function to send outgoing messages.  
While functional, this method can trigger spam filters depending on your server’s `php.ini` configuration.

### Recommended: Use SMTP for Reliability

Each email account can use its own SMTP settings, or you can define a system-wide default.

**To set up SMTP:**
1. Go to **Admin Panel → Emails → Emails → Outgoing (SMTP)**.  
2. Choose your email account.  
3. Enable **SMTP Authentication**.  
4. Enter your SMTP server details:
   - Hostname (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
   - Port (usually 465 for SSL or 587 for TLS)
   - Username (your full email, e.g., `support\@yourdomain.com`)
   - Password (your email password or app password)
5. Save the configuration.

> **External SMTP Restrictions**  
> Some hosting providers (e.g., HostGator) block connections to remote SMTP servers.  
> If you see “login failure” messages, contact your host or test your connection manually.

### Test Your SMTP Connection

You can use the `telnet` command to check SMTP connectivity:

```bash
telnet smtp.example.com 25
```

If the connection is blocked, you may see:

```bash
Trying 192.0.32.10...
telnet: connect to address 192.0.32.10: Connection refused
```

In such cases, your hosting provider’s firewall or policy is likely blocking external SMTP traffic.

## Allowing SMTP Spoofing (Optional)

You can enable outgoing address spoofing to prevent osTicket from overwriting custom “From” addresses.

**To enable:**
1. Navigate to **Admin Panel → Settings → Email Settings**.  
2. Check **Allow Spoofing (No Overwrite)**.

## Outlook Configuration

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "2%", height: 0, overflow: "hidden", maxWidth: "100%", height: "auto" }}>
  <iframe
    width="560"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBT2qordWFs"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

---

## Gmail Configuration

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "2%", height: 0, overflow: "hidden", maxWidth: "100%", height: "auto" }}>
  <iframe
    width="560"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xs1k_ocnfd8"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Step 1: Enable IMAP or POP in Gmail

1. Log in to your Gmail or Google Workspace account.  
2. Go to **Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP**.  
3. Enable either POP or IMAP.

   - [Enable IMAP for Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en)

### Step 2: Configure osTicket for Gmail SMTP

In osTicket:
1. Go to **Admin Panel → Emails → Emails → Sending Email via SMTP**.  
2. Enter:
   - Server: `ssl://smtp.gmail.com` (Port 465) or `tls://smtp.gmail.com` (Port 587)  
   - Username: full email address (e.g., `support\@yourcompany.com`)  
   - Password: your Gmail or App Password  
3. Check **Authentication Required** and **leave Header Spoofing unchecked**.  
4. Save and test.

---

### Step 3: Check for Common Issues

#### Firewall Restrictions
- Outgoing ports 465 and 587 must be open.  
- If using CSF, ensure `SMTP_BLOCK` is disabled or add the osTicket user to `SMTP_ALLOWUSER`.  
- Add necessary ports to `SMTP_PORTS`.

#### SELinux
If SELinux is blocking the connection, disable it temporarily to test.  
If it works when disabled, re-enable it and create a rule allowing outgoing SMTP connections.

#### Gmail Security Settings
- Ensure “Allow less secure apps” is **enabled** during testing.  
- For Gmail interface:
  1. Click your avatar → **My Account**.  
  2. Go to **Sign-In & Security → Connected Apps and Sites**.  
  3. Enable **Allow less secure apps**.

> **Note:**  
> Do not leave this enabled permanently. It should only be used for troubleshooting.

#### G-Suite SMTP Relay (Recommended for Organizations)
If you’re using Google Workspace (G-Suite), configure an **SMTP Relay Service** instead:

1. Go to **Admin Console → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Advanced Settings → Routing**.  
2. Add an SMTP relay with:
   - Allowed senders: your domain or specific IPs  
   - Authentication: via IP or username/password  
3. Use `smtp-relay.gmail.com` as your SMTP server in osTicket.

For more details, see [Google’s SMTP Relay Documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2956491?hl=en).
