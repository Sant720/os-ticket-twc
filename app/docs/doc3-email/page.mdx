# How to Configure Email Fetching and Outgoing Mail in osTicket

Follow these steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the documentation site.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later (check with `node --version`)
- npm 10 or later (`npm --version`)
- Git installed and authenticated with GitHub

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sant720/os-ticket-twc.git
cd os-ticket-twc
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies (including Nextra and the Docs theme):

```bash
npm install
```

> If installation stalls, cancel with `Ctrl+C` and rerun the command—it’s usually an npm registry hiccup.

## 3. Start the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to view the docs. Edits to `.mdx` files hot-reload automatically.

## 4. Recommended Editors & Extensions

- **VS Code** with the MDX extension for syntax highlighting.
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** integrations to keep formatting consistent.
- **GitHub Copilot** or similar tooling is optional but helpful.

## Troubleshooting

- **`next: not found`** — run `npm install` to restore `node_modules`.
- **Hydration warnings** — disable browser extensions that inject DOM attributes (e.g., Grammarly).
- **Branch pushes fail** — verify you’re on `main` and your remote is updated (`git status`, `git fetch origin`).
