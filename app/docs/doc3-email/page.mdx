# Email Fetching and Outgoing Mail

osTicket allows you to set up multiple email addresses to handle your company’s communication channels.  
Incoming emails can be converted into support tickets, helping you organize and manage all email requests in one place.

This guide explains how to configure **incoming email fetching** and **outgoing mail delivery** in osTicket.


## Before You Begin

- Ensure osTicket is already installed and configured.  
- You must have **Admin Panel** access.  
- Confirm that your mail server credentials (username, password, host, and port) are correct.  

## Email Templates


## Routing Incoming Emails

osTicket supports two main methods for fetching incoming mail:

### 1. Email Piping (Real-Time Delivery)
Email piping allows instant ticket creation as messages arrive.  
However, it requires configuration at the mail server level.

**To enable email piping:**
1. Access your hosting control panel or mail server configuration.  
2. Create an alias or pipe that sends emails directly to osTicket’s pipe handler (usually `pipe.php`).  
3. Verify that your server supports piping.

## Configuring Outgoing Emails

By default, osTicket uses the **PHP mail()** function to send outgoing messages.  
While functional, this method can trigger spam filters depending on your server’s `php.ini` configuration.

### Recommended: Use SMTP for Reliability

Each email account can use its own SMTP settings, or you can define a system-wide default.

**To set up SMTP:**
1. Go to **Admin Panel → Emails → Emails → Outgoing (SMTP)**.  
2. Choose your email account.  
3. Enable **SMTP Authentication**.  
4. Enter your SMTP server details:
   - Hostname (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
   - Port (usually 465 for SSL or 587 for TLS)
   - Username (your full email, e.g., `support\@yourdomain.com`)
   - Password (your email password or app password)
5. Save the configuration.

> **External SMTP Restrictions**  
> Some hosting providers (e.g., HostGator) block connections to remote SMTP servers.  
> If you see “login failure” messages, contact your host or test your connection manually.

### Test Your SMTP Connection

You can use the `telnet` command to check SMTP connectivity:

```bash
telnet smtp.example.com 25
```

If the connection is blocked, you may see:

```bash
Trying 192.0.32.10...
telnet: connect to address 192.0.32.10: Connection refused
```

In such cases, your hosting provider’s firewall or policy is likely blocking external SMTP traffic.
