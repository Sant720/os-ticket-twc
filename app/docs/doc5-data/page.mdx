# How to Export and Extract Data from osTicket

This documentation portal is powered by **Next.js 16** running in the App Router with the **Nextra Docs Theme** layered on top. The combination gives us static-first docs with client-side enhancements when needed.

## Core Layers

- **Next.js App Router** provides filesystem routing and streaming server-rendered React components.
- **Nextra** converts `.mdx` files into page routes and handles sidebar, navigation, and search indexing.
- **Tailwind CSS** (via the default Next.js template) powers the landing-page styling and utility classes.

## Rendering Flow

1. The App Router resolves a request to the appropriate file in `app/docs`.
2. Nextra compiles the MDX content, merges metadata from `_meta.json`, and injects it into the shared layout.
3. `app/layout.tsx` wraps the page with the Nextra `<Layout>` component, providing banner, navbar, and footer slots.

## Key Files

- `app/layout.tsx` — Connects Nextra’s layout with the site’s fonts and global styles.
- `app/docs/**/*` — Topic-based docs in MDX, grouped by folder.
- `theme.config.tsx` — Customizations for navigation, repository links, and logos.

## Extending the Architecture

Add new sections by dropping MDX files into `app/docs`, or expose reusable React blocks through `mdx-components.js`. The Nextra theme automatically updates the sidebar based on the content structure.
