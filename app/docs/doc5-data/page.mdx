# How to Export and Extract Data

osTicket provides several ways to **export ticket and dashboard data** into CSV files for reporting or analysis.  
This guide explains how to extract information from the **Agent Panel → Tickets** view and from the **Dashboard Tab**, as well as how to customize your exported fields.

## Before You Begin

- You must have **Agent** or **Admin** privileges to access export options.  
- CSV files can be opened with tools such as Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor.  
- Exports include only **metadata** (ticket IDs, statuses, dates, assignees, etc.) — attachments and conversation text are excluded.

## Exporting Ticket Data (CSV)

**Location:** `Agent Panel → Tickets`

Ticket exports allow agents to download ticket-header metadata in CSV format.  
You can customize which fields appear and filter results using Queues or Advanced Search.

### 1. Choose Tickets to Export

1. Go to **Agent Panel → Tickets**.  
2. Use **Advanced Search** to refine results by:  
   - Ticket Data  
   - User-related Data  
   - Organization Data  
   - Form Information  
3. When ready, click **Export** at the top-right corner to download a CSV file.

### 2. Customize Export Fields

You can decide which columns appear in your exported CSV.

1. Navigate to **Admin Panel → Settings → Tickets → Queues**.  
2. Under **Export Picker**, add or remove the fields you want to include.  
3. Save your changes.  

### 3. View Ticket Header Information

Each ticket’s header displays key metadata drawn from the built-in Ticket Details form.  
This is the same information available through CSV export.


## Using Advanced Search

`Advanced Search` lets you filter tickets by specific criteria before export.  
Use it to segment results by:

- **Ticket Information** (e.g., status, priority, SLA)  
- **User Information** (requester email, organization)  
- **Form Information** (custom fields)  

> See the [Advanced Search Guide](../Agent/Tickets/Advanced%20Search) for detailed usage instructions.

## Exporting Dashboard Data (CSV)

**Location:** `Agent Panel → Dashboard Tab`

The **Dashboard** provides an overview of ticket trends, workload, and performance metrics.  
You can export summarized activity data to CSV for long-term reporting.

### 1. Filter Your Dashboard View

Use the filters at the top of the Dashboard to limit data by:
- Date range  
- Department  
- Help Topic  
- Assigned Agent  

### 2. Export the Dashboard Data

At the bottom of the Dashboard view, click **Export** to download a CSV snapshot of your current filters.


The exported file contains ticket-activity metadata suitable for trend analysis or external reporting.

## Summary

You can now efficiently export ticket and dashboard data in osTicket for analysis or archiving.  

| Task | Where to Go | Output |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Export ticket metadata | Agent Panel → Tickets | CSV file of selected fields |
| Customize export fields | Admin Panel → Settings → Tickets → Queues | Tailored columns |
| Export dashboard statistics | Agent Panel → Dashboard | CSV snapshot of metrics |

For deeper filtering or data modeling, combine osTicket’s CSV exports with external tools such as Google Sheets or Power BI.
