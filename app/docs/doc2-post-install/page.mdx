# How to Configure osTicket After Installation

After installing **osTicket**, you need to perform additional configuration to make your helpdesk fully operational.  
This guide walks you through post-installation setup tasks such as configuring email, help topics, departments, and system preferences.

## Before You Begin

Only staff members with **Admin privileges** can access the **Admin Panel**.  
Log in using the **username and password** you created during installation.

Once you’re logged in, you can begin configuring your osTicket environment.

## Configure Email

osTicket allows you to route any number of email addresses to create tickets automatically.  
This enables clients to send messages directly to your support email (for example, `support\\@yourcompany.com`), which will be converted into tickets.

For complete setup instructions, see:  
[How to Configure Email Fetching and Outgoing Mail in osTicket](../email-configuration)

## Set Up Help Topics

Help Topics define how incoming requests are categorized and routed.  
They determine which department or priority a ticket is assigned to — without requiring the user to choose manually.

**Example:**
- *Billing Issue* → Routed to **Finance Department**
- *Login Problem* → Routed to **Technical Support**

To create and manage Help Topics:
1. Go to **Admin Panel → Manage → Help Topics**.  
2. Add or edit topics according to your service categories.  
3. Assign default departments, priorities, or SLA plans as needed.

## Create and Manage Departments

Departments allow you to:
- Categorize incoming tickets  
- Restrict ticket access based on department assignment  
- Define internal teams and responsibilities  

**Example:**
- Department: *Customer Support* → Staff access: Tier 1 agents only  
- Department: *IT Operations* → Access limited to system admins  

To manage departments:
1. Navigate to **Admin Panel → Agents → Departments**.  
2. Add a new department or edit existing ones.  
3. Assign default email addresses and auto-response settings.

## Add Staff Members

You can create unlimited staff accounts to manage tickets.  
Each staff member belongs to a **Group** (which defines permissions) and a **Department** (which defines ticket access).

### Staff Types
- **Admin:** Full system privileges, including settings and configuration.  
- **Staff:** Restricted access, limited to assigned tickets and departments.

To add staff:
1. Go to **Admin Panel → Agents → Add New Agent**.  
2. Assign a **Group** and **Department**.  
3. Configure login credentials and notification preferences.  
4. Save your changes.

## System Preferences

You can control system-wide behaviors and defaults under **Admin Panel → Settings**.

From this section, you can:
- Enable or disable features  
- Update organization name, time zone, and default email  
- Configure attachment limits, ticket numbering, and user registration rules

> **Tip:**  
> Review every tab in **Admin Panel → Settings** (System, Tickets, Emails, Users, Agents) to customize osTicket for your organization.

## Summary

Your osTicket system is now configured and ready to use.  
You can start receiving tickets via email or web form, manage workflows by department, and monitor support performance.
