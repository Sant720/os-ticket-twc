# How to Configure osTicket After Installation

Encounter a snag? Start with these known issues and resolutions before diving deeper.

## Installation Hangs

- **Symptom:** `npx create-next-app` or `npm install` stalls on dependency installs.
- **Fix:** Cancel with `Ctrl+C`, clear `node_modules` if present, and rerun `npm install`. Network hiccups are the usual culprit.

## `next: not found`

- **Symptom:** `npm run dev` fails with `sh: 1: next: not found`.
- **Fix:** Reinstall dependencies (`npm install`). The `next` binary lives in `node_modules/.bin`.

## Hydration Mismatch Warning

- **Symptom:** Browser console shows “A tree hydrated but some attributes…”.
- **Fix:** Disable browser extensions that manipulate the DOM (e.g. Grammarly). They add attributes to `<body>` that React doesn’t expect.

## Branch Push Rejected

- **Symptom:** `git push origin main` fails with `src refspec main does not match any`.
- **Fix:** Ensure the current branch is `main` and you have at least one commit. Use `git branch -m master main` and `git push --set-upstream origin main` if needed.

## Sidebar Missing

- **Symptom:** Running `npm run dev` shows a doc page without the sidebar.
- **Fix:** Confirm you’re on a `/docs/...` route and that `_meta.json` lists the page. Nextra hides the sidebar on standalone “page” routes.
