# Get started 

Welcome to the OS Ticket TWC knowledge base. This hub explains how the project is structured, how to run it locally, and where to contribute. Use the sidebar to jump into specific guides or follow the quick links below.

## Quick Links

- [Getting Started](./get-started) — install dependencies and spin up the local dev environment.
- [Architecture](#architecture-overview) — learn how the app is composed.
- [Contributing](#contributing) — guidelines and tooling expectations.

## How to Install osTicket

The documentation site uses **Next.js 16** with the **Nextra Docs Theme**. Content lives under the `app/docs` directory as `.mdx` files, allowing you to mix Markdown with React components.

Key directories:

- `app/` — Next.js App Router entry point.
- `app/docs/*` — documentation pages grouped by topic.
- `theme.config.tsx` — navigation, sidebar, and footer configuration.
- `mdx-components.js` — shared MDX components (callouts, badges, etc.).

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b docs/my-topic`.
2. Add or update `.mdx` content and run `npm run dev`.
3. Verify linting: `npm run lint`.
4. Commit with a descriptive message and open a pull request.

> Tip: keep sections short and action-oriented. Use tables or callouts when they communicate procedures more clearly than prose.

## Next Steps

Head over to [Getting Started](./get-started) to configure your environment and begin exploring the project.
