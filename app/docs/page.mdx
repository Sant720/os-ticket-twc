## Install osTicket

<Steps>
### Step 1: Download osTicket
 
Get the [latest version](https://osticket.com/download) of osTicket.

### Step 2: Upload Files
 
   Unzip the archive and upload everything inside the `upload` folder to your desired directory, for example:  
   - `/osticket/`  
   - `/helpdesk/`  
   - `/support/`

    <Callout type="info">
    Basic FTP knowledge is useful here. If you’re new to FTP, review your FTP client’s documentation for uploading files and setting permissions.
        </Callout>
 
### Step 3: Set Permissions
 
 The installer must be able to write to:
   ```bash
   include/ost-config.php
   ```
   Follow any permission instructions shown by the installer.

</Steps>


## Using the Installation Script

Once you’ve uploaded all files and set permissions, complete the installation via a web browser.

1. Open your browser and navigate to your osTicket URL, e\.g.:  
   ```
   http://www.yourdomain.com/support
   ```
   or directly to the setup path:  
   ```
   http://www.yourdomain.com/support/setup/
   ```

2. The installer automatically checks for:
   - correct paths  
   - permissions  
   - missing requirements

3. Follow the on-screen steps:
   - Fix any configuration errors before continuing.  
   - Fill out all required fields in the setup form.  
   - On successful validation, the installer creates and populates the database and writes the configuration file.

Once complete, osTicket will be installed with basic defaults.  
You’ll need to perform **post-installation configuration** to make it fully functional.

## Installing via Fantastico (cPanel)

If your hosting provider uses **cPanel**, you can install osTicket through **Fantastico**:

1. Log into your cPanel account.  
2. Open **Fantastico**.  
3. Follow the installation prompts for osTicket.

> **Important Notes**
> 
> - The Fantastico package (as of Jan 9 2010) sets the default email to `support\@system.com`.  
>   Update all default email addresses immediately in **System Preferences** and **Department Settings**.  
> - Fantastico packages may lag behind official releases.  
>   Check [osTicket.com](https://osticket.com/) for the latest version.


## Finishing Up

After successful installation:

1. Log in with the **admin username and password** you created.  
2. Verify that osTicket loads correctly.  
3. Secure your installation:
   - Change file permissions to remove write access:
     ```bash
     chmod 644 include/ost-config.php
     ```
   - Delete the `/setup/` directory.  
   - Enable your helpdesk system.

Next, continue with the [Post-Installation Configuration](../post-installation-config) guide.
