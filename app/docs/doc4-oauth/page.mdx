# How to Set Up OAuth 2.0 Authentication for Email

Once your documentation content is ready, follow this process to turn the local project into a hosted site.

## 1. Prepare the Build

Run the production build locally to ensure it succeeds:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles MDX, generates static assets, and outputs the site to the `.next` directory.

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

The docs currently require no secrets, but if you add integrations (analytics, search, etc.), define them using the Next.js [environment variables guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables).

## 3. Deploy Options

- **Vercel (recommended):** Connect the GitHub repository and select the `main` branch. Vercel auto-detects Next.js and runs `npm install`, `npm run build`, and the appropriate start command.
- **Static Export:** If you need a fully static bundle, run `next build && next export` and host the generated `out` directory on any static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, S3 + CloudFront).
- **Docker:** Use a multi-stage build to run `npm install --production` and `npm run build`, then serve with `next start`.

## 4. Post-Deployment Checklist

- Verify the `/docs` sidebar structure and page content.
- Confirm canonical URLs and metadata render as expected (`view-source` of a deployed page).
- Set up 404 handling; Nextra provides a default `_not-found` page you can customize.

> Tip: Enable preview deployments so writers can review changes before they merge into `main`.
