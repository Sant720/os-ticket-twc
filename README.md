This is a sample project for a Technical Writer Challenge from FullStack Labs. The goal is to: 

1. Select 5 features from a documentation project to improve.
2. Include a project logo and name
3. Create API documentation for the REST services of [Dummy Rest API](https://dummy.restapiexample.com/). 

This is a test change.
